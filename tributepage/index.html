            <blockquote cite="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03056244.2014.883111">The significance of
                Mandela can be considered in two related ways. First, he has provided through his personal presence as a
                benign and honest conviction politician, skilled at exerting power but not obsessed with it to the point
                of view of excluding principles, a man who struggled to display respect to all ... Second, in so doing
                he was able to be a hero and a symbol to an array of otherwise unlikely mates through his ability, like
                all brilliant nationalist politicians, to speak to very different audiences effectively at once.
